# warehouse-twin

A **digital twin of a grocery distribution center** — a zero-dependency discrete-event
simulation grounded in the operating statistics of a real multi-site WMS, built to answer
the questions warehouse operators and automation consultants actually ask:

> *"What happens to cutoff performance if volume grows 20%?"*
> *"Where's the bottleneck — and does adding two frozen-zone pickers fix it?"*
> *"What does a goods-to-person system need to hit for payback?"*

```
$ python run_demo.py

KPI                         BASELINE                     +2 FROZEN pickers

```

## Why this exists

I run WMS and integration for a real high-volume grocery distribution network
(~515K picks/month across nine temperature-zoned warehouses). Operational questions —
staffing, wave cadence, growth, automation investment — usually get answered by intuition
or spreadsheets. A parameterized simulation answers them with dynamics: queues, variance,
shift boundaries, and bottlenecks that spreadsheets average away.

The end state is an **AI-operated twin**: a copilot that takes the question in plain
English, designs the experiment, runs the simulation, and explains the trade-offs.

## How it works

```
orders (empirical 24h arrival curve)
   └─> unreleased pool ──[ wave release every N min ]──> zone queues
                                                          ├─ DRY    (picker pool)
                                                          ├─ COOLER (picker pool)
                                                          └─ FROZEN (picker pool)
        order completes when all lines picked ──> KPIs: cycle time, on-time %,
                                                  utilization, queue depth
```

- **Engine** (`twin/engine.py`): heapq-driven discrete-event core — no dependencies.
  Orders arrive on an empirical hourly curve; a wave process releases them on a cadence
  (mirroring real WMS wave planning); zone picker pools serve lines FIFO with exponential
  service times inside a pick shift.
- **Parameters as data** (`params/*.json` + `twin/params.py`): every scenario is a JSON
  override, e.g. `{"zones.FROZEN.pickers": 3, "orders_per_day": 576}` — the primitive an
  AI copilot can drive.
- **One-call API**: `run_scenario(params, overrides) -> KPI report`.

## Grounding & calibration (what's real, what's assumed)

Honest provenance matters more than false precision:

| Parameter | Source |
|---|---|
| 24h order-arrival curve | **Empirical** — normalized from 14 days of live host-import timestamps (shape only, volumes removed) |
| Lines per order (~11, lognormal) | **Empirical** — 30 days of order detail across 8 sites (range 6–14 by site) |
| Wave cadence | **Empirical** — ~480 waves/day network-wide, interval-released |
| Zone mix (55/30/15) | Representative of dry/cooler/frozen grocery operations |
| Pick rates (70/55/45 lph) | **Benchmark-set** — source transaction timestamps are date-grain, so per-hour rates aren't derivable; set from operator-day counts + industry ranges, flagged for tuning |
| Staffing | Sized to realistic utilization (~60–95%) against the empirical line volume |

All shipped values are rounded/representative — no proprietary data.

## Quickstart

```bash
python run_demo.py               # baseline vs +2 frozen pickers
python run_demo.py --growth 20   # baseline vs +20% order volume
```

Python 3.10+, stdlib only.

## Roadmap

- [x] v0.1 — DES core, empirical grounding, scenario overrides, two-scenario demo
- [ ] **AI copilot** — expose `run_scenario` as an MCP tool so an AI assistant designs and
      runs experiments conversationally ("find the picker mix that survives +30% volume")
- [ ] Multi-day runs, order carryover, and replication (confidence intervals)
- [ ] Automation modules: model a GTP/AMR zone (rate, capex) → payback analysis
- [ ] Waveless / order-streaming release mode (compare against wave-based)
- [ ] Slotting module: zone-share shifts from re-slotting decisions
- [ ] Browser dashboard with live scenario comparison
